That’s a great idea for a portfolio project! **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applied to **Q\&A over open-source woodworking books** is both niche and technically impressive—it shows off skills in:

- NLP / LLM integration
- Document processing & embeddings
- Search and retrieval
- Prompt engineering
- Backend design
- Possibly a front-end or chatbot interface

## ✅ Project Overview

**Title**: _“Woodworker’s AI Assistant: Q\&A over Open-Source Woodworking Books using Retrieval-Augmented Generation”_

**Goal**: Build an interactive system that allows users to ask natural-language questions about woodworking, and get accurate answers grounded in open-source woodworking literature.

## 📚 Data Source

- Collect **open-source woodworking books** (e.g., from Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, or public-domain PDFs).
- Example book: _“Woodworking Tools 1600–1900”_, or _“Handicraft for Boys”_ (1910), etc.

Convert the PDFs/HTML/text into structured chunks suitable for retrieval.

## 🧠 Features to Implement

- 🔎 **Semantic search over book content**
- ❓ **Ask a question, get an LLM-powered answer grounded in books**
- 📄 **Optional: show source passages used**
- 🔗 **Optional: clickable references to full text**
- 🧰 **Optional: filtering by book or topic (e.g., tools, joints, finishing)**

## 🚀 Stretch Features

- Voice input (via Whisper or browser)
- Conversation memory (chat history)
- Citation highlighting
- User upload of their own woodworking books (custom ingestion)
- Deploy as a chatbot
